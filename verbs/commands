# This is a set of semi-complex commands that might prove useful

# Find 'foo' recursively
grep foo * -R

# Find complex string with spaces, etc
grep 'complex string' * -R

## OR
grep "complex string" * -R

# Find 'foo' replace with 'bar' recursively
grep -rl 'foo' * -R | xargs sed -i 's/foo/bar/g'

# Make a directory and all subdirectories one thru six and don't echo errors if they already exist
mkdir -p one/two/three/four/five/six

# Make a symlink, update it, keep quiet if there is a problem
ln -sfn /absolute/path/to/origin /absolute/path/to/link

## Set the original filename in the new location
ln -sfn /absolute/path/to/original /absolute/path/to/linkfolder/
### ...will result in the link: /absolute/path/to/linkfolder/original
