Partition in Windows
Right click on My Computer > Manage > Partition Manager
Free-up black, unused space. No more than two primary partitions on older machines or you may need help.
*If you have Windows with a C and D drive on a laptop, you poor fool. You only need a C if you only have one disk.
**You should only see blue and black colors, primary partitions and free space.
***If you see other colors around D, such as green, you may need to back up D, then delete it, then resize C. (If you install to D:/Program Files on a laptop, you poor fool. That's only for desktops with two separate disks. You may need to reinstall several apps to C:/Program Files
Right click on a partition, probably D, and shrink the volume. 100000MB or 50000MB is probably good (100GB-50GB)
If D is about that big and/or has nothing on it, you can delete it rather than shrink it. But, backup or copy what is on it first, dah.

Use unetbootin to install your custom _ubuntu----.iso file to your USB (USB 3 doesn't like many 2012-2014 computers, sorry, use USB 2)

Find out how to boot to a USB with your computer. If you don't know how, search your computer model and "how to boot USB".
Acer requires you to "Enable F12 Boot Menu" in BIOS, so you press F12 when booting.
Others can boot to USB by changing boot priority in BIOS. Each is different.

Boot to the USB you created.

Plug in an Ethernet cable (or 'try _ubuntu' and get your WiFi connected, though WiFi may not work for the install.)
Install _ubuntu

Select your language (if you want Chinese support, install Chinese for best results. You can change the system language later.)

Check to "Download updates while installing". Some of these updates may not be available after the install.
Check to install 3rd party apps if you want the most convenience and support.

For Disk Setup, choose "Manual" or "Something else". Don't choose any of the pre-planned options.
*If you have four primary partitions, you may need to delete one, then create an extended partition in the free space first...
*Go to the menu, type "Gparted". Then create a new partition. If you can't, back up and delete D first.
*Then make the new partition "extended".
*Then restart the installer and follow the same steps to this point.

Disck Setup/Configuration (Manual / Something else)
*Always create these at the end of the available disk space first, to keep things changeable later on.
1. Create a "swap area" 10GB or 2x your total RAM, whichever is larger. (2x RAM less than 10GB if you need to save space)
2. Create an "ext4 extended/logical partition". Mount "/home" and make it big, but leave about 15-30GB for the OS, bigger is better for both.
*If you have a desktop computer with two hard drives, optimal is /home on a large HDD and / on the second part of an SSD.
*Either way, note which device your /home folder is on for step 4
3. Create an "ext4 extended/logical partition". Mount "/" and use the 15-30GB of space you left.
4. Choose to put the bootloader on the same base device as /home. (If /home is on sdb3, put the bootloader on sdb)
*Putting the bootloader on the same drive as /home is secure. Removing the drive will remove your files and _ubuntu boot capability.
*This also prevents Windows and the bootloader from conflicting by being on the same drive. Single-drive computers don't matter, but it is still the same.

Regional and Keyboard settings should use defualts. "English" keyboards use QWERTY layout, even for Chinese and Japanese stickers it's "English".

Name the computer:
I do one lower-case for the OS (Kubuntu = k, Windows = w, etc)
Then my own name with "Book" or "Desk" and something recognizable.
Then my initials at the end.
Camel-case (first word lower-case, all new words start with a cap)
eg: xWritingBookJS (Xubuntu, notebook I use for writing, I'm Jesse)
...I do this because there is no real standard for how in the bl@@ping w@rld to name computers. This is understandable.

"Automatically log on" is only if you don't mind everyone and their dog going through your secret batcave files. (Bad idea unless you're a busy mom wtih no batcave.)
"Encrypt my home folder" will encrypt /home, so booting will be difficult. This is for companies and Batman's and Fox's computers in the R&D and batcave, but not Bruce Wayne's office computer.

Enjoy
