#For gnome shell, you can install the gnome-tweak-tool:
sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool

#For Ubuntu unity, you can either install the gnome-tweak-tool or you can use the unity-tweak-tool to change themes:
sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool

#Download and extract all themes to your ~/.themes directory. Run the following command to create this directory:
mkdir ~/.themes

#This directory is hidden, so you must press CTRL + H after you open nautilus to display hidden files if the directory is not displayed.
#Once the theme has been downloaded and extracted to your ~/.themes directory, open either gnome-tweak-tool or unity-tweak-tool to select the theme.
